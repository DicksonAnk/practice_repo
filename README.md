### A repo for practising projects over and over again to get familiar with them.
### With time, the directories in this repo may be recreated with similar name only varying in a number appended to it to show the version of pratice.

Say for example the `shell-redirection` directory may have its newer version with the name `shell-redirection-1` to show that it's the newer directory created to practise the shell redirection project for the second time

## The purspose of the directory and file naming
For learning the different ways of solving the shell redirections project. File naming are different from the major one because a particular task here can have multiple ways of implementing it.

Hence, a file named as `0-hello\_world` and `0-1hello\_world` only differ in the code written in them but they perform the same task.

So the files `0-[0,1,2.....n]hello\_world`  where  _n_ is any integer from zero upwards are just files that do the same thing when run but have different codes written in them.
