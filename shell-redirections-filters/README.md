## What this directory contains
This directory contains files same as those in the alx-system\_engineering\_devops/0x02-shell\_redirections directory.

## The purspose of the directory
For learning the different ways of solving the shell redirections project. File naming are different from the major one because a particular task here can have multiple ways of implementing it.
Hence, a file named as 0-hello\_world and 0-1hello\_world only differ in the code written in them but they perform the same task.
So the files 0-[0,1,2.....n]hello\_world where n is any integer from zero upwards are just files that do the same thing when run but have different codes written in them.
